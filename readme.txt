# SmartNinja Homework #5 - Hair-Salon

Homework #5 in WebDevelopment 1 Course by SmartNinja.org
Task is to set up an homepage for a hair-studio using bootstrap.
Most of the bootstrap code used is basic bootstrap build, so the files are mostly in .gitignore.
You can get the original bootstrap here http://getbootstrap.com/.
